    as one of the defects this package exists to fix; this file had no ring at all, and
    `_read_journal` reads it whole, so it was also an unbounded allocation in the daily digest on a
    host whose entire discipline is about what a process may allocate.

    The ceilings are moved down rather than writing four megabytes to prove it. What is asserted is
    the invariant rather than a survivor list: the file is bounded, and the record that survived is
    the NEWEST one. A trim that kept the oldest records would bound the file just as well and lose
