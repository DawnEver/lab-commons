THE SOCKET IS A DOUBLE AND THAT IS THE POINT RATHER THAN A CONCESSION. `AF_UNIX` does not exist on
every platform this kit runs tests on, so a test that bound a real socket would SKIP exactly where
the code path most needs exercising -- and a guard that skips on a developer's box is a guard that
was never run when the module was written. What is being asserted is this module's own work: the
payload, the address it is sent to, and the two answers for "nobody is listening".
