"""What a cycle leaves behind, and what a day of them adds up to.

Two readers, two shapes. A PERSON wants one line that says whether anything is wrong and what is
being done about it. A DIGEST wants the same facts as data, because the daily roll-up is built from
a day of them and a roll-up parsed out of prose breaks the first time the prose is reworded.

THE DIGEST IS WHY A CYCLE WRITES A RECORD AT ALL. Every cycle appends one compact line; the daily
summary reads them back. Both halves live here so the writer and the reader cannot drift into
disagreeing about a field name -- the defect the predecessor had in its state, where two writers
used two spellings of the same counter.

WHAT IS REDACTED AND WHY. A delivery's detail is whatever a channel said back, and a channel that
refuses an address tends to refuse it BY NAME. A report is the most-copied artefact a supervisor
produces -- into a log, a chat, a ticket -- so an address or a bearer token is masked on the way in
rather than trusted not to travel.
