"""What a supervision check returns, and what a remedy chain is made of.

A check measures something and reports a :class:`CheckResult`: the numbers it read, the
:class:`Anomaly` objects it convicts, and the :class:`Completion` signals it celebrates. A
completion is deliberately NOT an anomaly -- a finished task is a first-class outcome, and
modelling it as a warning-severity anomaly makes a run that succeeded read as `degraded`
forever.

Nothing here knows what is being measured. A probe of an HTTP endpoint, a disk, a log tail and
a deployment all return the same four types, which is what lets one registry, one remedy engine
and one daemon drive all of them.

    IT LIVES BESIDE :attr:`Anomaly.signature` BECAUSE IT IS WHAT THAT FIELD MEANS. A signature is not
    a label for a component or a file or an exit code -- those are CONTAINERS, and a container is
    stable while its contents are not. It is the identity of the CONDITION, and the policy counts
    consecutive cycles per signature and writes a condition off once the count passes its threshold.
    A signature taken from a container therefore has two outcomes for a fresh failure: reported if
    nothing was wrong yet, and absorbed into the old condition's silence if something was.

    NUMBERS ARE FOLDED OUT because the text is reprinted on every cycle: a log line carries a date, a
    clock and an errno, a command's failure detail carries a timeout in seconds or a pid. Digesting
    the raw text would make ONE condition a new signature every cycle -- an alert storm, which is the
    opposite failure and the one that trains a reader to ignore the channel.
