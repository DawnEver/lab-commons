"""The one configuration a supervision target has, and the one way it is overridden.

ONE FILE, PLUS THE ENVIRONMENT. The predecessor carried two files -- ``config.yaml`` for structure
and a gitignored ``config.local.yaml`` for secrets -- merged in a four-step precedence. The second
file bought nothing the environment does not: a secret is something a deployment injects, and
systemd already has ``EnvironmentFile=`` for exactly that, with the file mode to match. So the
precedence here is two steps, and there is one file a reader has to open::

    environment  >  <config>.toml  >  the defaults below

TOML rather than YAML, which drops a dependency rather than adding one -- ``rtoml`` is already
tier 1 and the family's configs are already TOML. A YAML parser for one file was a second
serialisation format to keep working.

WHY A MISSING FILE IS NOT AN ERROR. A daemon that refuses to start because its config has not been
written yet cannot report that fact, which is the one thing it is for. It starts on the defaults
instead and supervises nothing -- and the loop refuses to call a run with no components enabled
`healthy`, because a scan that read nothing is not a clean scan. The refusal lives where it can be
reported, not where it would be silent.
