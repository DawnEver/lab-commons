"""Reaching a service's process through whatever manages it.

The deploy engine asks this package four questions and never asks what the answers come from, which
is what keeps a deployment's algebra -- validate, activate, verify, roll back -- the same on a host
with systemd and on one without.

ONE IMPLEMENTATION TODAY, SYSTEMD, and that is deliberate rather than unfinished. The seam's job is
to keep ``systemctl`` out of the deploy engine, and a seam is proven by the engine running against
something else -- which a test double does, in the suite, on every change. A second production
manager for a host nothing deploys to yet would be an abstraction for a need that does not exist;
adding one later is four methods and no change to any caller.
