"""Whether to say something, and why -- one place, three brakes, one answer.

The predecessor kept half of this in its state module and half in its alert module: the counters
lived with the state, the cooldown lived with the transport, and the rule that joined them existed
in neither. Reading either file could not tell you when an alert would be sent.

There are three brakes and they do different jobs, which is why one of them would not do:

* **the signature** -- what the condition IS. When it changes, the situation genuinely moved, so
  suppression releases. This is the brake that stops a rotating commit sha from being mistaken for
  a condition that will not go away.
* **the cooldown** -- how long between two notifications, whatever they are about. A supervisor
  that has been failing for an hour has told you already; saying it every cycle is noise.
* **the write-off** -- after this many identical sightings the repeats stop entirely. A condition
  that has not moved in twenty cycles is not news, and continuing to send it trains a reader to
  ignore the channel. Escalation is the deliberate exception: it is how a write-off is overridden
  when persistence is itself the problem.

A DECISION IS PURE GIVEN THE STATE, but this function does update the state's counters, because
they are the inputs to the next decision and separating the read from the write would leave the
rule split across two calls -- which is the defect this module exists to undo.
