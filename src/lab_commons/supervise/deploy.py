"""The phases of a release: fetch, prove, activate, verify, roll back.

THE ORDER IS THE WHOLE POINT. The 2026-10-01 incident that this engine exists to prevent was a
commit that imported a banned dependency at module scope: it deployed cleanly, killed the service
on start, and took fifty minutes to notice because the only check after activation was a liveness
probe that never opened a data file. So a release here is PROVEN BEFORE IT IS ACTIVATED -- built in
its own tree, started on its own port, asked real questions -- and activation only happens once
something has answered them.

WHAT IS GENERIC AND WHAT IS NOT. Every phase is a command the configuration supplies and a URL the
configuration names. The engine knows the SHAPE -- worktree, install, start, probe, restart, verify,
roll back -- and nothing about winding data, Python packaging or systemd units beyond the process
manager it was handed. A target that deploys a Go binary configures different commands and the
engine does not change.

PRODUCTION IS NEVER LEFT BROKEN. The only phase that touches the live target is activation, and
every failure after it rolls back to the newest verified snapshot, restarts, and verifies the
rollback too -- a rollback that is assumed to have worked is how a bad afternoon becomes a bad day.
