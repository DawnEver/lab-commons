"""One supervision cycle: measure everything, act on what is wrong, say what happened.

The order is the whole design. Measure first and act second, because a remedy chosen before the
measurement is a remedy for last cycle's problem. Say what happened third, because an alert that
precedes the action cannot report its outcome.

CHECKS RUN ONE AT A TIME, and that is deliberate rather than lazy. This family deploys to a
two-core box where a supervisor running its probes concurrently is a supervisor competing with the
service it supervises -- and the memory ceilings the rest of this kit enforces would be beside the
point if the supervisor itself forked a fleet. A check that hangs is bounded by
``cycle.check_timeout``; the thread behind it is ABANDONED rather than killed, because Python
cannot kill a thread, and that limit is stated here rather than hidden.

MUTUAL EXCLUSION IS THE BROKER'S, not a lock of this module's own. A second cycle on the same
target is refused with a message naming the holder. The kit states the rule plainly -- a byte-range
lock, a pid file or a heartbeat would each be a second definition of the same thing -- so the seat
is taken from :class:`lab_commons.resources.Broker` and there is no other.
