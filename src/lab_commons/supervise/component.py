"""What a component is, what it is handed, and how the registry finds it.

A component measures one thing and optionally knows how to act on it. That is the whole contract,
and the reason it is worth stating precisely is that the predecessor stated it implicitly in three
places at once:

* an action a component implements in Python was reached by ``hasattr`` on an undeclared method, so
  the interface existed only in the dispatcher's head -- and this kit bans reflection outright;
* that method was called with ``global_cfg={}`` -- an EMPTY mapping, not the real config -- so a
  component written against the documented signature silently read nothing;
* components were discovered by walking a directory and instantiating every ``Component`` subclass
  found, so what ran depended on which files happened to be present.

Here a check is handed ONE context object, an implemented action is declared in a table by name,
and discovery reads an explicit ``COMPONENTS`` list. Nothing is found by looking for it.
