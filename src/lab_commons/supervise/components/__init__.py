"""The components this build ships, and the roster a target adds to.

A ROSTER, NOT A DIRECTORY WALK. The predecessor found its components by walking a directory and
instantiating every ``Component`` subclass it found, so what ran depended on which files happened to
be present -- and a file left behind by a branch switch silently joined the supervision. Here the
list below IS the shipped set, and a target's own module states its contributions in a
``COMPONENTS`` list of its own.

Grouped by family rather than one file per probe: ``health`` asks whether something answers and
whether its answer is what it should be, ``resources`` asks whether the box is running out of
anything, ``progress`` asks whether a long job is still moving, and ``deploy`` asks whether a
release is safe to activate. Four questions, four files.
