"""Is a long job still moving, and has it finished.

A FINISHED JOB IS NOT AN ANOMALY, and the predecessor learned that the hard way: it modelled
completion as a warning, so a run that had succeeded reported `degraded` forever, stayed on the
anomaly cadence, and could trip escalation on its own success. Completion is a first-class outcome
here -- it makes the run `complete` rather than `degraded`, and it enters no remedy chain.
