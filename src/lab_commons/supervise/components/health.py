"""Probes: is it answering, does the answer say what it should, and is the supervisor still going.

Three questions worth telling apart. An endpoint that refuses a connection is down; one that
answers 200 with ``"status": "degraded"`` is UP AND SAYING SO, and a check that only looks at the
socket cannot tell those apart. The predecessor's HTTP probe had exactly that blind spot: it parsed
the body into JSON and then never looked at the status code, so a 500 with a JSON error document
counted as reachable.
