These report; none of them acts. A disk filling up has no remedy this kit can honestly apply on its
own -- deleting somebody's files to make a number go down is not a repair -- so a target that wants
one declares a chain in its own config, where the choice is visible.

wants only the HTTP probes must not need it installed to import this module. Its absence is

    that already had an old one was indistinguishable from that old one. The policy counts
    consecutive cycles PER SIGNATURE and writes a condition off once the count passes its threshold,
    after which it is reported as "the same condition has held for N cycles" and never again. So the
    scanner had exactly two outcomes for a fresh exception: if no log held an error yet, it was
    reported; if one did, the new failure was absorbed into the write-off of the old one and the
    channel went quiet.

    That is the failure this component exists to catch. It watches for an unhandled exception landing
    outside a request -- the shape that leaves `/health/` answering 200 while something is wrong --
    and it was blind precisely when something was already wrong.

    The digest is taken over the matched lines with their NUMBERS FOLDED, because a log line's date,
    clock and errno change on every write: hashing them would make one condition a new signature
    every cycle. Folding keeps what names the failure -- the message, the path, the frames -- and
    drops what only dates it.
