"""The always-on loop: run a cycle, wait, run another, until told to stop.

A SUPERVISOR DOES NOT MANAGE ITSELF. There is no pid file here and no self-restart ladder, because
the kit's own rule is that a second lock is a second definition of the one that exists, and because
a process supervised by a process manager has no business supervising itself. Under systemd the
unit carries ``Restart=always``; the liveness question is answered by the manager, and it is asked
of the OS rather than of a timestamp this module wrote down.

WHAT THIS DOES OWN is the two things a loop must get right and a timer cannot: it does not overlap
itself, and it stops when asked. A cycle that finds the seat taken SKIPS rather than fails, because
the other cycle is the one doing the work. A signal sets a flag and the cycle in flight finishes
first, so a restart never lands mid-remedy -- a systemd restart that interrupted a deployment would
leave the target in a state no later cycle knows about.

AND IT IS WHERE A STALE SUPERVISOR FINDS OUT IT IS STALE, which the paragraph above cannot cover. A
deployment installs its own units and can upgrade the kit this process runs from -- and a Python
process goes on executing the modules it imported at startup no matter what lands on disk
underneath it. Measured on 2026-10-03: a kit fix was deployed, the daemon kept running the previous
one, and two cycles of evidence were recorded under the OLD rules before anybody restarted it by
hand. :func:`definition_signature` says what is compared; :attr:`Loop.definition` says what happens
when it moves, and the answer is that the loop EXITS.

EXITING IS THE POINT, NOT A WORKAROUND. Asking the manager to replace us and replacing ourselves
are different acts: the first is a process supervised by a process manager behaving correctly, the
second is the self-restart ladder this module's first paragraph refuses. And it cannot be done from
inside anyway -- a restart issued by the process halfway through writing this cycle's state would
kill the writer, and the deployment would be unrecorded.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO IS DECIDE WHERE RECORDS GO. The loop hands each cycle's result to a callback
and the entry point chooses the journal, which keeps the digest's writer in one place instead of
having this module grow an opinion about files.

    Two ingredients, and they are the two ways a deployment replaces a running supervisor:

    * **The kit's own installed version.** A deployment that upgrades this package puts new modules
      on disk, and the running process keeps the old ones until it is replaced.
    * **The content of the named files.** A unit file is read by the manager at start; a config the
      unit points at is read by whoever reads it. Neither reaches a process already running.

    A MISSING FILE IS A FACT AND NOT AN EMPTY ONE. A path that cannot be read records
    ``<unreadable>`` rather than nothing, so a deployment that DELETED a file is a change like any
    other -- reporting it as absent would make the one case that most needs a replace the one case
    that looks like no change at all.
