"""How a notice reaches a human: four channels, one shape, and no reason to raise.

A supervision run that finds something wrong and cannot say so has done nothing. The predecessor
had this right in outline -- one transport module, channels gated by their own ``enabled`` -- and
wrong in three details this fixes:

* it sent HTML. A deployment alert is a line of text and a link; markup buys nothing and adds an
  escaping bug between a commit subject and a mail client. Everything here is plain text.
* it built its own failure paths so a channel that threw took the others down with it. Each channel
  is delivered independently and reports its own outcome, so one broken webhook cannot silence the
  email beside it.
* its ``urlopen`` carried no verification. The connection goes through an injected ``Transport``
  over :mod:`http.client`, which is this family's established spelling and the reason it exists.

NOTHING HERE DECIDES WHETHER TO SEND. Throttling, deduplication, cooldown and escalation belong to
:mod:`lab_commons.supervise.policy`; a transport that also suppressed would put the rule in two
places, and the predecessor's did exactly that -- half the suppression lived in its state module and
half in its alert module, which is why neither could be read on its own.
