"""Applying a remedy chain -- one implementation, for every caller that has one.

The predecessor stated this requirement and then split the implementation across two: a module for
the daemon and a loop for the AI, with the chain resolution duplicated between them. It recorded
the debt itself -- *"remedy 链双处声明(组件硬编码 vs config)优先级统一"* -- and never paid it, which
is why a chain could mean two things depending on who ran it.

WHAT A STEP IS. A gate, an action, and a retry count. The gate is a severity and an optional
metric comparison; the action is either a shell line or something a component implements; the
retry count is how many times to try before giving up on this step. Nothing here decides WHETHER
to alert about the outcome -- that is :mod:`lab_commons.supervise.policy`, and keeping the two
apart is what lets either be read alone.

A REMEDY COMMAND RUNS UNDER A CEILING. Every command goes through the process manager's capped
runner, so a reinstall or a migration cannot take the host down while the supervisor watches.
